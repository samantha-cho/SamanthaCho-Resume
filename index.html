        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Sociology</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! I am currently a first-year student who attends the University of California Riverside. Although I do not have any professional experience and have never had an actual professional job, I do have many characteristics that may be useful or appealing in a professional setting.<br><br>
        
        Firstly, I feel that I am a strong communicator who can befriend anyone, have the ability to create a comfortable and positive environment, and am a very hard worker. One of my strengths is being able to communicate and converse with anyone. I am someone who enjoys the company of others and am always excited to learn something new. I have confidence in my public speaking abilities, projecting clearly with detailed explanations.<br><br>

        Not to mention, I am welcoming and someone that can create a positive atmosphere for others. I have a very bubbly personality and an open-minded attitude toward life. Thus, it causes people to reach out to me. I can give advice when necessary, but I am also able to listen well too. I can empathize well and enjoy providing guidance to others who seek help. If there are any issues, I adapt quickly and can tend to most situations.<br><br>

        Furthermore, I am hard working as well. When a task is put in front of me, I am determined to complete it and do so in an organized and timely manner. Even when the job is challenging, I am focused, diligent, and persevere till the end. I do everything in my power to produce the best work possible.<br><br>
        
        Additionally, I believe that I am dependable and trustworthy. When I make a promise, I keep it and make sure that I deliver them in the best way possible. I do not just provide “lip service”, however, I make sure to match my words with my actions. I make sure to “do my homework”.<br><br>
        
        Lastly, I would describe myself as open-minded and optimistic when it comes to learning new things. Rather than exuding pride, I try to absorb as much information as I can and grow my knowledge. I enjoy getting advice and recommendations from others as well as am not afraid to ask for help when I need it. I just want to execute my job as well as possible and when it comes to information, there is always something new a person can learn.<br><br>
        
        These are just a few aspects of who I am as a person and what I stand by. Overall, I strongly believe I am a person of character. I am someone who is trustworthy and dependable. I respect everyone, believe in being fair, and that everyone deserves equal treatment. Also, I think I am honest and am caring towards others. I try to be the best person I can be and influence others in a positive, bright side kind of way.<br><br>
        
        Thank you for your consideration and for taking the time to read this. I hope that I am someone you are interested in hiring/working with. If you choose to consider me, I know you will not be disappointed. ;)<br><br>
